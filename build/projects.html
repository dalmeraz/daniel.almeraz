			<td>GANs for cats and dogs</td>
			<td>Keras, Python</td>
			<td>
				Created a generative adversarial neural networks that created images of cats
				and dogs with the purpose seeing if these newly created images could be used as data 	augmentation which when added
				to the training dataset resulted in an increase in accuracy from 73.3% accuracy to 76.4%.

					<tbody>
			<td>Game Theory Tournament</td>
			<td>Java</td>
			<td>
				reated a custom agent to compete in a tournament that had three different
				options in strategies: maxmin payoff, minimax regret, and max average payoff. Which to use was found through a random
				selector that learned and favored choices that did better using a softmax function.
			</td>
			<td>2019</td>
			</tbody>

			<tbody>
			<td>Image segmentation</td>
			<td>OpenCV, Python</td>
			<td>
				Created an image segmentation program that used a disjoint set forest
to group together similar areas of an image and tested potential improvements.
			</td>
			<td>2018</td>

			<td>daniel.almeraz.com</td>
			<td>HTML, CSS</td>
			<td>
				In an endevor to become a more well rounded programmer, wrote a personal portfolio as a project to create a bigger exposure for myself to Front End Web development and learn the prosses of getting a website from HTML to publishment.
			</td>
			<td>2018</td>

		<tbody>
			<td>Sudoku</td>
			<td>Java, GitHub</td>
			<td>
				Java JAR following MVC. Started as a one person team and then began expanding as more features
				became implemented to a total of four members. Game could generate a starting board that is either 9x9 or
				4x4, connect with other players through the use of their port and IP to solve together, check if its current
				state is solvable/actually solve it, undoing/redoing moves, show possible moves and other small features.

			</td>
			<td>2018</td>
		</tbody>
		<tbody>
			<td>Dark City</td>
			<td>C#, Unity Interface</td>
			<td>
				Game created in organization Game Builders that creates immersive games which utilize virtual humans that are able to recognize speech and gesture. Worked on scene development for the game.	
			</td>
			<td>2017</td>
		</tbody>
		<tbody>
			<td>Washing Machine</td>
			<td>Verilog</td>
			<td>
				Created a washing machine simulator for the NI Digital Electronics
				FPGA Board. The machine had several buttons and switches that simulated the addition of money, and a
				procedure to several different washing cycles that occurred when their requirements were met.
			</td>
			<td>2017</td>
		</tbody>
		<tbody>
			<td>Knapsack</td>
			<td>Java</td>
			<td>
				Solved different variations of the knapsack problem using a greedy algorithm in a variation were fractions of items could be taken, dynamic where there were several of each item, and backtracking when there was only one of each item.
			</td>
			<td>2018</td>
		</tbody>
		<tbody>
			<td>Maze Creator and Solver</td>
			<td>Java</td>
			<td>
				Created a maze using a disjoint set forest that is then solved using both depth-first search and breath-first search on an adjacency list form of the maze.
